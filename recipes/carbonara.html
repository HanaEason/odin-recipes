      <p class="para">
         The best carbonara in Italy? Though there is quite a bit of debate on the subject, there are two names that always stand out in the “top ten” versions of carbonara in Italy - two names who have created more than just a signature dish out of the traditional recipe, but a lifestyle, too.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
          The two subjects? Alessandro Pipero, maître and owner of Pipero, and Luciano Monosilio, his young chef - working side by side for years at the starred restaurant in Rome.

          Their carbonara is a legend, but this is an even further embellished version - if it was possible to make it any better - with the unusual extra touch of grappa. The grappa they use? Prime Uve Bianche from the Bonaventura Maschio distillery - where they distill the white grapes for a fruity, delicate and floral flavor that pairs wonderfully with classic carbonara. Here is the recipe:

      <h3 class="subheading">Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul class="para">
         <li>11 oz spaghetti</li>
         <li>4 egg yolks</li>
         <li>1.5 oz grated Parmigiano cheese</li>
         <li>0.75 oz grated Pecorino cheese</li>
         <li>A pinch of ground black pepper</li>
         <li>7 oz guanciale cut into 1 cm cubes</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="subheading">Steps:</h3>
      <ol class="para">
         <li>Cook the pasta in boiling water as indicated on the package.</li>
         <li>In a large frying pan, brown the guanciale over high heat, gradually removing the fat that releases as it cooks. Set excess fat aside in a separate bowl.</li>
         <li>Whisk the egg yolks with the grated Parmigiano Reggiano and pecorino cheese, adding the drained fat from the guanciale. Let rest.</li>
         <li>Once the pasta is cooked, mix with the eggs and guanciale in a steel bowl away from heat. If necessary, add a little hot water.</li>
         <li>Complete with ground pepper and serve. Grate the remaining pecorino cheese directly onto the plate and serve at the right temperature: not too hot, but warm.</li>
      </ol>
